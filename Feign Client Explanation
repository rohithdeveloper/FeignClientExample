✅ What is Feign Client?
Feign Client is a declarative HTTP client in Spring Boot used to call another microservice.

👉 Instead of writing RestTemplate or WebClient code manually, you just define an interface, and Feign automatically makes the HTTP call.

🔹 Problem Without Feign
Normally to call another service:
  RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
  String response = restTemplate.getForObject(
      "http://localhost:8081/users/1", 
      String.class
  );
You must:
Create URL
Handle headers
Handle errors
Manage response mapping
Too much boilerplate 😓


With Feign Client (Very Simple)
You just write an interface like this:
  @FeignClient(name = "user-service", url = "http://localhost:8081")
  public interface UserClient {
  
      @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
      User getUserById(@PathVariable("id") Long id);
  }
That's it ✅
Feign will automatically:
Create HTTP call
Map JSON to Object
Handle serialization

for Example:
Suppose:
🟢 User Service runs on port 8081
🔵 Order Service runs on port 8082
Order Service needs user details before placing an order
Instead of writing HTTP logic manually using RestTemplate, we used Feign Client, which is provided by Spring Cloud.
